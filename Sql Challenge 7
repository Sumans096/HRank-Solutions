Challenge 7: 
Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
The STATION table is described as follows:


where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Sample Input

For example, CITY has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY.

Sample Output : ABC 3
                PQRS 4
Explanation : 

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with lengths  3,3,4 and 3 . The longest name is PQRS, but there are 3 options for shortest named city. 
Choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.
Note : You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query.





--- SQL 
-------------------------------1st Approach : Using ORDER BY, LIMIT & UNION ALL -------------------------------------------------
(select city, length(city)as max_length from station
order by length(city) desc, city asc 
limit 1)
union all 
(select city, length(city) as min_length from station
order by length(city)asc, city asc 
limit 1);


----------------------------------2nd Approach:  Using Subqueries ---------------------------------------------------------------
(select city, length(city) 
from station
where length(city) = (select max(length(city) ) from station)
order by length(city)  desc, city asc
limit 1)
Union ALL
(select city, length(city) 
from station
where length(city)  = (select min(length(city)) from station)
order by length(city) asc, city asc
limit 1);


------------------------------------3rd Approach : Using Window Function CTE -------------------------------------------------------
with cte 
as (
    select city, 
        len(city) as city_len,
        row_number() over(order by len(city) asc, city asc)as min_length,
        row_number() over(order by len(city)desc, city asc)as max_length
    from station
);

select city, city_len from cte
where min_length = 1 OR max_length = 1 
group by city;
